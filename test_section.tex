\subsection{Steps to use Overleaf with Jupyter
notebook}\label{steps-to-use-overleaf-with-jupyter-notebook}

The steps were as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  We created an article in Overleaf first
\item
  We then pushed the article to github
\item
  We visited github and copied the address of the article that we'd
  clone
\item
  We then created a new git repository on our machine where we have
  cloned the directory (in our case, we called that ``work'')
\end{enumerate}

Now,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We have added a jupyter notebook
\item
  The jupyter notebook will let us add text using markdown documentation
\item
  We will continue to store our bibliography information on the
  references.bib file in bibtex format
\item
  We will add citation information using
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}cite\{citationid\}}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Next Steps}\label{next-steps}

We will convert this notebook to latex using two steps: In the first
step, we will convert the notebook to a markdown file, using

\texttt{jupyter\ nbconvert\ test\_section.ipynb} This will convert this
notebook to markdown format. Then we will convert the test\_section.md
to test\_section.tex using pandoc as

\texttt{pandoce\ -f\ markdown\ -t\ latex\ -o\ test\_section.tex\ test\_section.md}

We will then do some more things:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  We will create .gitignore file that will contain all files with
  extension \texttt{*.ipynb} as git as problems in maintaining them.
\item
  Optionally, if we do not want to share our markdown files, we will add
  \texttt{*.md} files to the list as well.
\item
  Lastly, and optionally, we can add the new \texttt{test\_section.tex}
  file to the \texttt{main.tex} file using the
  \texttt{\textbackslash{}input\{test\_section\}}
\end{enumerate}

After we have done these three changes, we will then push the files to
the git repo using:

\begin{verbatim}
git pull origin master
git add test_section.tex main.tex
git commit -m "added test_section files"
git push origin master
\end{verbatim}

Then, once we are in Overleaf, we will pull in the changes to Overleaf
and work on Overleaf.
